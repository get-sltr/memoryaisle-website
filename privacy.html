          <li>Location access requires your explicit permission through your device's operating system. You may grant or revoke location permissions at any time through your device settings</li>
          <li>Location data is used solely for the purpose of providing store-proximity notifications</li>
          <li><strong>Location data is not tracked, stored, or retained on our servers beyond the active session</strong></li>

          <li>Receipt images are processed using OCR technology to extract item and pricing information</li>

          <li>Audio data from voice commands is processed in real time to convert speech to text</li>
