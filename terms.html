By using Mira, you expressly acknowledge, understand, and agree to the following:</p>
        <h3>8.1 Not Professional Advice</h3>
        <p><strong>Mira is NOT a medical professional, licensed dietitian, nutritionist, or healthcare provider.</strong> All suggestions, recommendations, and information provided by Mira are for general informational and convenience purposes only. Mira's output does not constitute and should never be interpreted as medical advice, nutritional counseling, dietary prescriptions, or professional healthcare guidance.</p>
        <h3>8.2 Accuracy and Limitations</h3>
        <p>Mira is powered by artificial intelligence and may produce responses that are inaccurate, incomplete, outdated, or inappropriate. AI-generated content may contain errors, omissions, or hallucinated information. You should independently verify any information, recommendations, or suggestions provided by Mira before relying on them, particularly with respect to food allergies, dietary restrictions, ingredient safety, nutritional values, and medical conditions.</p>
        <h3>8.3 Allergy and Health Disclaimer</h3>
        <p><strong>YOU ASSUME ALL RISK</strong> associated with following any recipe, meal plan, ingredient suggestion, or dietary recommendation provided by Mira. It is your sole responsibility to verify all ingredients for potential allergens, cross-contamination risks, and suitability for your or your family's specific dietary needs and health conditions. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider, allergist, or licensed dietitian before making dietary changes, especially for individuals with known food allergies, intolerances, or medical conditions.</p>
        <h3>8.4 Data Handling</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Mira processes your queries and family preference data to generate personalized responses. This data is handled in accordance with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></li>
          <li>Mira does not access external accounts, contact lists, or data sources beyond what you explicitly provide within the App</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>8.5 Limitation of Liability for AI</h3>
        <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SLTR DIGITAL LLC SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INJURIES, LOSSES, OR ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR RELIANCE ON INFORMATION, SUGGESTIONS, RECIPES, MEAL PLANS, OR RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDED BY MIRA, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALLERGIC REACTIONS, FOOD-BORNE ILLNESSES, NUTRITIONAL DEFICIENCIES, OR ANY OTHER HEALTH-RELATED CONSEQUENCES.</p>

        <h2>9. Location Services and Geofencing</h2>
        <p>MemoryAisle offers location-based features, including store geofencing, which can notify you of relevant shopping lists when you arrive at or near a designated store. By enabling location services, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Location access requires your explicit permission through your device's operating system settings. You may grant or revoke location permissions at any time through your device's Settings app</li>
          <li>Location data is used solely for the purpose of providing store-proximity notifications and is not tracked, stored, or retained beyond the active session, as described in our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></li>
          <li>Location accuracy depends on your device hardware, GPS signal strength, network conditions, and environmental factors. We do not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of location-based notifications</li>
          <li>Continuous use of location services running in the background may increase battery consumption on your device</li>
          <li>Disabling location permissions will prevent geofencing features from functioning but will not affect other App functionality</li>
          <li>We do not share your location data with third parties for advertising, marketing, or any purpose unrelated to providing the Services</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Receipt Scanning and Image Processing</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Receipt scanning requires access to your device's camera. You may grant or revoke camera permissions at any time through your device settings</li>
          <li>OCR technology is not perfect. Extracted data may contain errors, omissions, or inaccuracies due to image quality, receipt formatting, handwriting, or other factors. You are responsible for reviewing and correcting any scanned data</li>
          <li>Receipt images may contain sensitive information such as partial payment card numbers, store loyalty identifiers, or other personal data. You are solely responsible for the content of images you capture and submit through the App</li>
          <li>Receipt images are processed to extract relevant data and are handled in accordance with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></li>
          <li>We do not use receipt data to build advertising profiles, share with third-party marketers, or for any purpose other than providing and improving the Services</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Voice commands require access to your device's microphone. You may grant or revoke microphone permissions at any time through your device settings</li>
          <li>Audio data is processed to convert speech to text for the purpose of executing your commands within the App</li>
          <li>Voice recognition accuracy may vary based on ambient noise, accent, speech patterns, device hardware, and network conditions. We do not guarantee the accuracy of voice-to-text conversion</li>
          <li>Audio recordings are not permanently stored on our servers. Processing occurs in real time, and audio data is discarded after the command is processed</li>
          <li>Voice command functionality will not operate if microphone permissions are denied, but all other App features will remain available</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12. Family Sharing and Household Features</h2>
        <p>MemoryAisle allows users to create family groups and share lists, meal plans, and other content with household members. By using family sharing features, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The account holder who creates a family group ("Family Admin") is responsible for inviting members and managing the group</li>
          <li>All content shared within a family group is visible to and may be modified by all members of that group. You should only share content that you are comfortable making available to all group members</li>
          <li>Family members may add, edit, and remove items from shared lists and content. The Family Admin is responsible for the actions of invited members</li>
          <li>Family member profiles may include dietary preferences, allergy information, and other health-related data. The Family Admin is responsible for ensuring that this information is accurate and kept up to date</li>
          <li>The Family Admin may remove any family member at any time. Removed members will immediately lose access to shared content</li>
          <li>When a family member is removed or leaves a group, their personal data and preferences associated with the family group may be deleted in accordance with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></li>
          <li>Each family member who uses the App must comply with these Terms. The Family Admin assumes responsibility for ensuring that invited members, including minors for whom they have guardianship, are aware of and comply with these Terms</li>
          <li>Premium family sharing features (such as expanded member limits) require an active MemoryAisle Premium subscription</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>13. Device Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App may request access to certain device capabilities to provide its full range of features. These permissions are requested through your device's operating system and are always under your control:</p>

        <p>You acknowledge that you use the App at your sole risk and discretion. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from us or through the App, shall create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms.</p>

        <h2>21. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SLTR DIGITAL LLC, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, DATA, USE, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE THE APP OR SERVICES; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON OR THROUGH THE APP; (C) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE APP, INCLUDING AI-GENERATED CONTENT; (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR DATA OR TRANSMISSIONS; (E) ALLERGIC REACTIONS, ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS, OR INJURIES RESULTING FROM RECIPES, MEAL PLANS, OR DIETARY SUGGESTIONS PROVIDED BY THE APP OR MIRA; OR (F) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE APP OR SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF SLTR DIGITAL LLC FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE APP SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO US IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM; OR (B) FIFTY UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($50.00).</p>
        <p>THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY AND EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS, OUR LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

        <h2>22. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless SLTR Digital LLC and its officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to: (a) your violation of these Terms; (b) your use of the App or Services; (c) your User Content; (d) your violation of any rights of any third party; (e) your violation of any applicable law, rule, or regulation; or (f) any claim that your User Content caused damage to a third party.</p>
        <p>This indemnification obligation shall survive the termination of these Terms and your use of the App.</p>

        <h2>23. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <h3>23.1 Informal Resolution</h3>
        <p>Before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceedings, you agree to first contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@memoryaisle.app">legal@memoryaisle.app</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute informally for a period of at least thirty (30) days. Most disputes can be resolved through good-faith negotiation without the need for formal proceedings.</p>
        <h3>23.2 Binding Arbitration</h3>
        <p>If we are unable to resolve a dispute informally, you and SLTR Digital LLC agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms, the App, or the Services (collectively, "Disputes") shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding individual arbitration, rather than in court, except that either party may bring an individual action in small claims court if the claim qualifies. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect.</p>
        <h3>23.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>
        <p><strong>YOU AND SLTR DIGITAL LLC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> Unless both you and we agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.</p>
        <h3>23.4 Exceptions</h3>
        <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of intellectual property rights.</p>

        <h2>24. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>These Terms and any Disputes arising out of or relating to them shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles. To the extent that any legal proceeding is permitted under these Terms outside of arbitration, you and SLTR Digital LLC consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of California and waive any objection to venue or inconvenient forum.</p>

        <h2>25. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. The unenforceable provision shall be replaced with a valid, enforceable provision that most closely reflects the intent and economic effect of the original provision.</p>

        <h2>26. Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>These Terms, together with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and any additional terms or policies referenced herein or agreed to in writing, constitute the entire agreement between you and SLTR Digital LLC with respect to the App and Services, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, whether written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof.</p>

        <h2>27. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. When we make material changes, we will: (a) update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page; (b) provide notice through the App, via email to the address associated with your account, or through other reasonable means. Your continued use of the App following the effective date of any changes constitutes your binding acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must discontinue use of the App and delete your account.</p>
